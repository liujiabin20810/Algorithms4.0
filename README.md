# Algorithms4.0
This is a self project for Algorithms, The textbook Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.  It's C++ code.

It contains or will contain the follow parts: 
1. Sorting : considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.
2. Searching: describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, redâ€“black trees, and hash tables.
3. Graphs : surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.
4. String: investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.

The program language of the  textbook is Java, To improve the coding ability, I change it to C++.
